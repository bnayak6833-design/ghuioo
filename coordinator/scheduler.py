"""
scheduler.py — Background reliability layer for the OpenTrain coordinator.

Three periodic jobs run every SCHEDULER_INTERVAL_SECONDS:

  1. check_heartbeats()
       Marks workers offline when their heartbeat goes stale.
       Reassigns (or fails) every in-flight task they owned.

  2. check_task_timeouts()
       Catches tasks that are still "assigned" but whose worker never
       reported back within TASK_TIMEOUT_MINUTES — even if the worker
       itself is still sending heartbeats (e.g. worker is alive but hung
       on one task forever).

  3. check_stalled_jobs()
       Catches jobs that are stuck in "in_progress" with zero pending or
       assigned tasks remaining — can happen if a race condition leaves
       done_tasks out of sync. Re-derives done_tasks from the DB and
       triggers aggregation if everything is actually complete.

All three functions open their own DB session so they are safe to call
from a background thread independent of the FastAPI request lifecycle.
